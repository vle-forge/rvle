/**
 * @brief Converts a vle value into a SEXP object
 *
 * @param val, the vle value to convert
 *
 * @param with_class_names, if true:
 * attribute class of returned SEXP is set in order to identify the type of
 * value and avoid ambiguous conversions. Class names are :  VleBOOLEAN,
 * VleINTEGER, VleDOUBLE, VleSTRING, VleSET, VleMAP, VleTUPLE, VleTABLE,
 * VleXMLTYPE, VleNIL, VleMATRIX and VleMULTIPLE_VALUES. Multiple values
 * represent a set of different values for designing experiment plans
 *
 * @param multiple_values, if true and val is a SET:
 * val is considered as multiple values. Essentially developped for multiple
 * values on condition ports used for experiment plans
 *
 * @param unlist_multiple_values,
 * if true and multiple_values=true and val is a SET of size 1:
 * the conversion returns the first and only value of the SET rather than a
 * list of one element (required for backward compatibility)
 *
 * @param matrix_type, (depends on matrix_type_depth)
 * - if matrix_type = 0 and val is a MATRIX:
 * the returned SEXP is a list with attribute 'dim'
 * - if matrix_type = 1 and val is a MATRIX:
 * the returned SEXP is a dataframe, expecting that first row contains names.
 * A dataframe contains only atomic data ('character', 'logical, 'double')
 * - if matrix_type = 2 and val is a MATRIX:
 * the returned SEXP is a matrix of doubles, expecting that all data
 * are doubles. A dataframe contains only 'double'
 *
 * @param matrix_type_depth,
 * defines the depth (in terms of number of recursivity) at which the parameter
 * matrix_type is taken into account. Before the detph is reached,
 * the matrix_type is 0. If matrix_type_depth <= 0,
 * then it concerns the current depth.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - 'multiple_values', 'unlist_multiple_values' are not used recusrively.
 * Default values (ie. 0) are used for conversion of vle values contained
 * into 'val'.
 * - 'without_class_names' and 'matrix_type' are used recursively.
 * - 'matrix_type_depth' is decreased by one at each recursive call
 *
 * @return the SEXP value
