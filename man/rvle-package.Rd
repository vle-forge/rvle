\title{
R package for VLE framework
}
\description{
This package couples the VLE modelisation and simulation 
software framework to R framework.
It provides methods for simulating VLE models from R.

Functionnalities allow the user to modify inputs of a VLE model, to
call simulation routines and to get the results back into R data structures.
Based on the notion of experiment plan (different combinations of inputs,
simulations can be performed in parallel using threads.

A 'VPZ' in the VLE framework refers to a model and a design of experiment
for simulation. A 'condition' refers to a set of inputs/parameters of the
model and is attached to a VPZ. Two sets of methods are provided into
the package:

1) a basic API provides methods for manipulating a rvle handle (a simple
pointer on a VPZ c++ structure). Methods of the basic API are most often
prefixed by "rvle.". Type 'help("rvle-handle")' for more information.

2) a user friendly set of functionnalities provided into an S4 class
implementation "Rvle". It relies on the basic API and provides high level
functions compared to the basic API. Type 'help(Rvle)' for more
information.
